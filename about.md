### An __Algorithm__ 
is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values as output." In other words, algorithms are like road maps for accomplishing a given, well-defined task.
However, it's important to note that a programming algorithm is not computer code. It's written in simple English (or whatever the programmer speaks). It doesn't beat around the bush--it has a start, a middle, and an end 

#### __Why use algorithms and not simply write code ?__

* Codes are language dependent i.e they vary in accordance with the syntax of a language whereas algorithms  include only what you need to carry out the task. 

* It does not include anything unclear, often called ambiguous in computer lingo, that someone reading it might wonder about. 

* It is important to realise that when you understand a problem , you must concentrate on the logic of the problem rather than getting confused by the syntax of the languages.

#### __What do we provide ?__

* We help you search plain and simple algorithms , keeping the design of algorithms away from any language syntax .

* We have clubbed these algorithms into various suitable categories which enables you to find similar algorithms under one roof so that one can easily go about exploring. 

 __For Example:-__  if you will search bubble sort then you would first land up in the category of sorting . Then you can access various sorting algorithm including bubble sort 

 * This way of searching and modularizing content in categories enables you to look through other available and more optimized sorting algorithm.

  

#### __Why to learn Algorithms when you need to make them into code ?__

 * When you learn to code , it is important to understand algorithms so that you can understand the logic behind the code .

 * If you are working on an important piece of software, you will likely need to be able to estimate how fast it is going to run. Such an estimate will be less accurate without an understanding of runtime analysis(time and space complexity ). Furthermore, you need to understand the details of the algorithms involved so that you’ll be able to predict if there are special cases in which the software won’t work quickly, or if it will produce unacceptable results. 

 * Of course, there are often times when you’ll run across a problem that has not been previously studied. In these cases, you have to come up with a new algorithm, or apply an old algorithm in a new way. The more you know about algorithms in this case, the better your chances are of finding a good way to solve the problem. In many cases, a new problem can be reduced to an old problem without too much effort, but you will need to have a fundamental understanding of the old problem in order to do this.
